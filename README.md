ðŸ‘‹ Hey, my name is Justin. Im fairly new to this programming world but each day I am trying to better my skill profile.
ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m really interested in Biomedical Engineering specifically the design and mechanics of prosthetics and human physiology.
ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning R as a programming language and how it is used to clean, analyze, and present data found in clinical science.
